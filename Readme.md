# Feasibility Study Report: Carpooling System

## 1. Title:
**Project Title:** Carpooling System Feasibility Study

## 2. Objective:
To evaluate the practicality, technical requirements, and overall viability of developing a carpooling system similar to BlaBla using the MERN stack, with an emphasis on creating a scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform.

## 3. Outline:
This report outlines the feasibility analysis for the proposed carpooling system. It includes an assessment of technical, economic, operational, legal, and environmental factors, as well as the tools and methodologies that will be used to ensure a successful implementation.

## 4. Background:

**a) Introduction:**
The carpooling system aims to connect drivers and passengers heading in the same direction, optimizing transportation efficiency and reducing environmental impact. The system will leverage the MERN stack for development and will be designed to be both scalable and secure.

**b) Type:**
This is a web-based application focusing on real-time service integration and user experience, targeting both desktop and mobile users.

**c) Steps:**
- **Technical Feasibility:** Evaluation of the MERN stack, Figma for UI/UX design, and other necessary technical resources.
- **Economic Feasibility:** Analysis of development and operational costs versus potential revenue.
- **Operational Feasibility:** Assessment of system integration into current workflows with minimal disruption.
- **Legal & Ethical Feasibility:** Compliance with relevant data protection laws and ethical considerations.
- **Schedule Feasibility:** Estimated project completion within 6-8 months.
- **Environmental Feasibility:** Positive impact expected due to reduced vehicle usage.

## 5. Tools Used:

- **UML:** For modeling system architecture.
- **ER Model:** To document the database structure.
- **Draw.io:** For creating diagrams.
- **Domain Classes:** For defining entities and behaviors.
- **CASE Tools:** To aid in various stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
- **Web Development Tools:** Figma for UI/UX design.

## 6. Software Engineering Lab Objectives:

**a) Life Cycle:** 
- The project will follow the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) stages, including planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

**b) CASE Tools:** 
- Upper CASE tools for planning and analysis.
- Lower CASE tools for implementation, testing, and maintenance.
- Integrated CASE tools for end-to-end development support.

**c) UML Models:**
- Use Case Diagrams, Class Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, and Activity Diagrams will be employed to visualize and document the system design.
